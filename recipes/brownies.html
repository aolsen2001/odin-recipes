<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Brownies are a desert staple. Each bite brings sweetness and a rich chocolate flavor.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
    <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper.
        Spray the parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for
        40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the
        brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.</li>
</ol>
